=============

|License badge| |Docker badge|

The DeviceManager handles all operations related to creation, retrieval,
update and deletion of devices in `dojot`_. For more information on that,
check `DeviceManager Concepts page`_.

Dependencies
------------

DeviceManager has the following dependencies:

-  flask (including flask_sqlalchemy)
-  psycopg2
-  marshmallow
-  requests
-  gunicorn
-  gevent
-  json-logging-py
-  kakfa-python

But you won’t need to worry about installing any of these - they are
automatically installed when starting DeviceManager. There must be,
though, a postgres instance accessible by DeviceManager.

How to run
----------

If you really need to run DeviceManager as a standalone process (without
dojot’s wonderful docker-compose), you can execute these commands:

.. code:: shell

    python setup.py develop
    gunicorn device-manager.app:app

Keep in mind that running a standalone instance of DeviceManager misses
a lot of security checks (such as user identity checks, proper
multi-tenancy validations, and so on). In particular, every request sent
to DeviceManager needs an access token, which should be retrived from
`auth`_ component.

How to use it
-------------

There are a few concepts that must be understood to properly use
DeviceManager. Visit `DeviceManager Concepts page`_ to check them out.

This component listens to HTTP requests at port 5000 - all its endpoints
are documented in the `API page <api.html>`_.

**IMPORTANT**: If you are using all dojot’s components (for instance, using a deploy based on
`docker-compose`_), it is recommended to visit `dojot documentation`_
to check the endpoints for all services (including DeviceManager’s)**
